                Why We Built BLU ZAP
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>As web applications evolve, traditional security tools struggle to keep up with the complexity of
                    modern cloudnative environments. We built BLU ZAP to fill this gap. Unlike other solutions, BLU ZAP
                    is engineered to be cloudfirst, offering a streamlined way to secure dynamic cloud environments. Our
                    tool automates security testing without sacrificing the thoroughness needed to address modern
                    threats. </li>
                <li>Our mission is to empower organizations by making highend security testing tools accessible to teams
                    of all sizes, allowing them to maintain compliance and secure their applications without disrupting
                    their development cycles.</li>
                <li>From development through to deployment, BLU ZAP covers the entire security lifecycle of your web
                    applications. With Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security
                    Testing (DAST) capabilities, it provides a comprehensive solution to identify vulnerabilities both
                    in your application’s source code and in its running environment.</li>
                <li>SAST helps identify vulnerabilities in the source code, allowing development teams to catch flaws
                    early, significantly reducing remediation costs.</li>
                <li>DAST simulates realworld attacks on live applications, identifying vulnerabilities such as injection
                    flaws, crosssite scripting (XSS), and more.</li>
